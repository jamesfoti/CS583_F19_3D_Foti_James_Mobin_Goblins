# CS 583 (3D Game Programming) - 3D Game
**Game can be played here (WebGL):** https://jamesfoti.github.io/CS583_F19_3D_Foti_James_Mobin_Goblins/index.html <br/><br/>
**Game can be played [here (Standalone)](https://github.com/jamesfoti/CS583_F19_3D_Foti_James_Mobin_Goblins/tree/master/Versions/1.0)** and by runnig **CS583_F19_3D.exe** by downloading it and double clicking on it.<br/><br/>
**Note:** the game was developed for Windows/Mac/Linux Standalone rather than WebGL so the sizing and positions of the UI and some game objects are a little distorted when you play the WebGL version. If you want to play the game without any uneccessary UI issues, play the Standalone version (link above). <br/><br/>
